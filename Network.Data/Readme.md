Different lines of internet

Every device have MAC Address (eg. D0:27:88:AA:BB:CC)



- SFBB (Superfast Broadband Lines) lines -> 30 Mbps – 100 Mbps
- UFBB (Ultrafast Broadband Lines) lines -> 100 Mbps – 1 Gbps+

- for lines < 10 Mbit/s, < 30Mbit/s, < 300Mbit/s

_______

-> Adaptive Load Balancing
-> Predictive Resource Redistribution
-> Dynamic Spectrum Allocation


Potential algorithms:
-> Graph Neural Network (GNN)
-> Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
-> Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)


-> Community detection (Louvain algorithm) (https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/louvain/)
